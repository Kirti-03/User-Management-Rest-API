This project is a **Spring Boot-based User Management REST API** that allows users to be **created, retrieved, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations)** using **MySQL** as the database.
It is built with **Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Web**, ensuring efficient data handling and seamless API communication.  

The API enables **user registration** with fields like **name, email, and address**, and securely stores the data in a MySQL database.
It provides various endpoints for **fetching all users, retrieving a specific user by ID, updating user details, and deleting users**.
The application follows a layered architecture, including **controllers for API endpoints, services for business logic, and repositories for database interactions**.  

The **Spring Boot framework** simplifies development by handling dependency injection and configuration management.
**Spring Data JPA** ensures smooth database operations with minimal boilerplate code, while **MySQL** acts as a persistent data store.
The project also includes **Spring Boot DevTools** for real-time application updates during development.  

To run the project, **clone the repository, configure MySQL connection details in `application.properties`**, and execute the application using **Maven** or a Java IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**.
